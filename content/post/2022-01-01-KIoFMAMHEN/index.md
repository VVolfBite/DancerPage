## 研究目标

<br/>

本项目在考虑多边缘网络的互联互通效率、模型异质、动态性与安全性的基础上，充分利用联邦机制的知识共享以及数据安全能力，解决在未来新基建网络中打通底层基础设施时所面临的难点问题，最终形成基于联邦共建的异质边缘网络融合模型、网内联邦算法效率提升、轻量实时更新与安全性能保障的一体化多边缘网络互通机制的综合理论体系和系统。

Although the current construction method of edge network can be deployed rapidly, it also brings heterogeneous characteristics, which makes it difficult to realize data interconnection and knowledge exchange among multi edge networks. At present, the traditional federated learning methods are very strict in the network characteristics and application model, which can not meet the requirements of heterogeneous networks integration. To address the above problems, this project proposes an asynchronous federation framework to achieve efficient, lightweight and reliable federation among heterogeneous edge networks.

1. We explore the integration and co-construction mechanism of heterogeneous network, and design model distillation method to realize the integration of heterogeneous network federation.

2. In order to improve the training efficiency of the above asynchronous federated model, we construct a resource knowledge map and design the flexible construction and mapping method to improve training efficiency in edge networks.

3. To solve the problem that the large-scale asynchronous federation model is difficult to update or re-train in real time, we then design a lightweight and efficient updating mechanism based on knowledge drift.

4. To make the whole framework credible and robust, an asynchronous federation mechanism verification method is also proposed.

   ​	These research results of this project can be applied to the construction of new infrastructure network scenarios, and provide references for heterogeneous network deployment and knowledge fusion, which has very important theoretical significance and practical value.
