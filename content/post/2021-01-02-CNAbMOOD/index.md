## 研究目标

<br/>

针对链下应用网络(如5G、IoT等)的数据由于海量规模和高实时性而难以上载区块链系统的问题，本项目将结合应用网络的数据特征，综合考虑数据维度、交易频率、跨链机制等多角度信息，提出父链与子链共存的嵌套链机制，利用子链进行降维降频，实现链下海量实时信息与链上数据协同，保证链下应用网络信息完整、安全、高效上链。

It is well-known that it is difficult to upload the data from off-chain application networks (such as 5G, IoT, etc.) to the blockchain system due to the massive data scale and high real-time transactions. To bridge this gap, this project comprehensively considers the multidimensional data and proposes a nested chain mechanism where the main chain and sub chains coexist, and the sub chains are in charge of reducing data dimensions and reduce transaction frequency, so as to realize the collaboration between massive real-time off-chain information and the on-chain data. Finally, we try to guarantee the availability, security and efficiency of off-chain applications.
